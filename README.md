# Idetta Maestro Server

This repo contains a basic prototype of the database and server for the Idetta Maestro musical game and practice scheduler. It is written using .NET Core with Entities Framework and a SQL Server database. This is still very much a work in progress and contributors are welcome. See the [https://github.com/JBJBEnoit/Idetta-beta](Idetta-beta repo) for more details about the frontend application.
